"""
Helpers for DB-backed entity images (tasks, methods, conferences).

Curated hero/figure images used to live as static files under
`frontend/public/images/<entity>/<slug>.png` and seed PNGs under
`data/entity_image_seeds/<entity>/`. They now live in the database in
two columns per row:

  - `image_data`       BYTEA, deferred so list queries never load the blob.
  - `image_mime_type`  small VARCHAR, always loaded, also used as the
                       "this row has a DB image" flag.

`entity_image_url` turns that flag into the public URL the API returns, and
`load_entity_image` fetches the bytes for the serving endpoints.
